        <p>Lay Aside Every Weight was founded 2003.  This service is the 1:1 component of In His Image.  It utilizes the Restoring the Foundations by Chester and Betsy Kylstra curriculum.  People are given 1:1 Biblical Sessions weekly.  Each session is designed to teach participants how to learn to discover their purpose by hearing the Holy Spirit for themselves.</p>
        <p>Often people are bogged down by past occurrences.  Lay Aside Every Weightâ€™s first objective is to assist the people in releasing their past by guiding them through past issues and helping them to move beyond them so that they can live freely.</p>
        <p>A group Bible study is taught monthly.  This Bible Study focuses on intergrading what is taught during individual sessions into the group setting.  Lay Aside Every Weight uses the Bible as a tool to teach how Christ lived, so that people can learn to walk into His Image.</p>
        <p>After participants find out their purpose, Lay Aside Every Weight works to assist them in finding a career that matches their purpose.  Participants are taught to write cover letters and resumes.  They also go on mock interviews.  Some participants are even taught to start their own businesses.</p>
