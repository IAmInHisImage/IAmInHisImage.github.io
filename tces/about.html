                <h2>Academics</h2>
                <h5>Trinity Christian Educational School offers a Christian Education that is like no other. Trinity Christian Education School is open to all students of average to superior intellectual ability, who are underachieving in traditional school settings and could benefit from a more personalized academic program or desire lower teacher to student ratios. At TCES, we are excited to offer personal attention from teachers who are trained to deal with a variety of learning differences. With a maximum of twelve students per class, students are afforded the kind of individualized support that results in personal accomplishments in the school environment. All classes have a trained teacher and a volunteer teaching assistant. The high School classes offer a full curriculum of courses required for graduation. A variety of different instructional methods are utilized in order to prepare the students for transitioning from post high school to college/vocational training/military service or employment opportunities. Teachers also focus on spiritual development, building traditional study skills including attending to lectures, note taking, participation in classroom discussion, and daily work, preparing for midterms and finals, and completing research reports.</h5>

                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <h5>The philosophy of  T.C.E.S.  is a simple one, based on the elements of accomplishment.  T.C.E.S. recognizes that  people have learning differences, which may hinder their level of achievement in a traditional academic situation.  With the right set of activities and individual attention, all students can achieve academic success in school.  Success positively affects self-esteem. The students are taught to thrive spiritually, emotionally, and academically.  The system is a multi-faceted approach to education, including a full complement of academic courses, plus a variety of extra-curricular activities and enrichment programs.  Small class sizes enhance the academic experience.  T.C.E.S.  graduates are educated spiritually, academically, emotionally, socially, and physically and motivated to go out in the world to duplicate the process and pursue their own purpose in life, thus creating ACCOMPLISHMENTS. </h5>
