            <p>Mrs. Beverly White is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Marion and Geraldine Lomax.  She is a loving and caring mother to her children LeChelsea, LeDarrius, and LeAerialle White. She is a member of The Equipping Center where Pastors Hasker and Deanna Hudgens preach. Mrs. White attended Coastal Carolina University where she received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Physical Education with an emphasis in Recreation.  She resided in Conway S.C. for three years and began a career teaching Physical Education and Math in Horry County Schools and Managing Horry County’s After School Programs.  She also was a Recreational Specialist for Island Green Amenities.</p>

        <div class="column column block">
            <p>Mrs. White returned to the Upstate in 1997 when she was hired as a Recreational/Residential Counselor at Generations Group Home.  She remained in her position at Generations Group Home until she was offered a position at Greenville County Commission on Alcohol and Drug as a Drug and Alcohol Counselor.  Later she became the Director of Circle of Friends Therapeutic Child Treatment Division.  There she enjoyed teaching Parenting Classes, researching the development of children born to mothers on alcohol and drugs, counseling families, facilitating groups, among many other responsibilities.  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column column block">
            <p>After several years of working with and seeing the needs of youth and their families, God called Mrs. White in September 1999 to develop the services Encouraging Words, Creative Sunsets, and Lay Aside Every Weight.  These services fall under IN HIS IMAGE, an educational non-profit organization.  Upon getting the call, Mrs. White enhanced her education receiving a Dual Master of Arts Degree in Human Resource Development and Human Resource Management from Webster University.  In 2002 she accepted a position at Calvary Christian School in Belton SC where she was mentored by Mr. Keith Mitchell.  In 2004 she birthed King’s Kids, Kingdom Communications, and Trinity Christian Educational School which are more services provided by IN HIS IMAGE. </p>

        <div class="column column block">
            <p>Mrs. White enjoys educating individuals, families, and communities and passionately does so through the six services provided by In His Image.  When working with families, she often reminds parents of two of her sayings: “Adults never stop playing instead they learn to play by God’s rules” and “children and youth should stay out of opposite sex relationships until they can answer the question, who are you?” Mrs. Beverly White’s greatest desire is to be like Christ so that she can help others to be like Him as well, thus she humbly accepts God’s call to be the Visionary of IN HIS IMAGE.</p>
